  <button class="accordion">Buying vs Leasing</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p><em>Here's a quick summary of buying vs leasing:</em></p>
    <p><strong>Buying a Car:</strong> <br>

      Buying a car can be a big decision, and there are several factors to consider.
      Some pros of owning a car include increased mobility, convenience, and the potential for savings over public transportation in the long term.
      However, there are also cons to consider, such as the upfront costs of purchasing a vehicle, ongoing expenses like fuel and maintenance, and the potential
      for unexpected repairs.
      To buy a car, the first step is to determine your budget and research different makes and models that fit your needs and preferences.
      Once you have found a car you are interested in, it's important to inspect it thoroughly and take it for a test drive to ensure it is in good condition.
      Negotiating the price with the seller or dealership is also an important step in the process.
      Other important considerations when buying a car include obtaining financing if necessary, purchasing insurance,
      registering the vehicle with the DMV, and keeping up with regular maintenance and inspections to keep the car in good condition.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Leasing a Car:</strong><br>

      Leasing a car involves renting a vehicle for a specified period of time, typically a few years, in exchange for monthly payments.
      Some pros of leasing a car include lower upfront costs compared to buying, lower monthly payments, and the ability to drive a new car every few years.
      However, there are also cons to consider, such as mileage restrictions, potential penalties for excess wear and tear,
      and the fact that you will not own the car at the end of the lease term.
      To lease a car, the first step is to research different makes and models to find one that meets your needs and preferences.
      You will then negotiate the lease terms with the dealership, including the length of the lease, the mileage limit, and the monthly payments.
      Once you have signed the lease agreement, you will make monthly payments to the dealership for the duration of the lease term.
      Other important considerations when leasing a car include obtaining insurance, keeping up with regular maintenance and inspections,
      and being aware of any potential fees or penalties for exceeding the mileage limit or causing excess wear and tear to the vehicle.
      At the end of the lease term, you will return the car to the dealership and have the option to lease a new car or purchase the leased car at a predetermined price.
